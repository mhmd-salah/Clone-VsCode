# VS Code Clone

**Description:**  
This project is a clone of the popular Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor, built using React, Redux Toolkit, and component recursion. The goal was to replicate key features and user experience while leveraging modern web technologies.

## Technologies Used:

- **React.js**: Utilized for building the interactive and dynamic user interface.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Employed to manage the global state effectively, ensuring seamless state transitions across the application.
- **Component Recursion**: Implemented to handle nested components, particularly for creating a dynamic and interactive file explorer similar to VS Code.

## Features:

- **File Explorer**: The file and folder structure is managed through component recursion, allowing for a nested and dynamic file system similar to VS Code.
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit was used to handle editor settings, open files, and other global states across the application.
- **User Interface**: The UI closely mimics the look and feel of the original VS Code, providing a familiar experience for users.
